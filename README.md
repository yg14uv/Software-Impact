# A Two-Tiered Framework for Anomaly Classification in IoT Networks Utilizing CNN-BiLSTM Model
Welcome to our GitHub repository. We present our robust security mechanism named the "Anomaly Classification System for IoT (ACS-IoT), structured as a two-tiered framework: the Inspection tier and the Detection tier. These tiers are designed to analyze network traffic and packets comprehensively, enabling the detection of any intrusion or attack. In the first tier, it employs machine learning-based classifiers for initial anomaly detection. In the second tier, a CNN-BiLSTM model is utilized for a more profound analysis and classification of anomaly types.

## Data Preprocessing
To build an effective anomaly classification system, we propose an efficient data preparation scheme that involves feature selection using PSO, data normalization, and data balancing using SMOTE. This scheme optimizes both the training process and anomaly detection, contributing to the overall effectiveness of ACS-IoT. 
Imbalance data present in the dataset can cause the model to identify minority classes as majority classes. This can cause the model to be biased and consequently degrades the model's performance and overall quality of the classification task. To overcome this issue, we have employed the SMOTE oversampling method which synthetically generates samples of minority class.
Another important function that is performed in the preprocessing step is that we have applied Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a feature selection technique in order to select the most important and distinguishing features from the input dataset. PSO not only reduced the computation cost but also saved the training time and memory. This also had an impact on the energy consumption of the system.

## Anomaly Classification
The IoT network consists of many flows generated at rapid rates. This big data environment requires highly efficient processing, which is one of the main challenges of anomaly classification methods in IoT networks. To solve this issue, the proposed ACS-IoT employs a decision tree binary classifier to detect anomaly flows efficiently. Decision Tree classifier works efficiently for binary classification problems. It tells if there is an anomaly or not. It cannot classify the type of anomaly as it is a less compute-intensive layer and only works as a filter to classify between normal and anomaly data. If there is no anomaly then the control will not pass on to CNN-Bilstm. This keeps the overall system lightweight and reduces the computation costs without compromising on the IoT vulnerability.
ACS-IoT deploys a Convolutional neural network (CNN), which focuses on feature extraction, facilitating effective categorization within the BiLSTM. CNN allows complex operations on the hidden layers to reduce the attributes and share weights. BiLSTM processes the variable-length sequential input data, and output can be produced at each recurrent step. Based on the recent input data and the previous step’s hidden neurons, hidden neurons at each time step are calculated. The extracted features of each flow are fed into the forward LSTM network and the backward LSTM network.

## Dataset
The dataset that is used in this work is the New IoTID20 dataset, which is developed for anomalous activity detection in IoT networks. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://sites.google.com/view/iot-network-intrusion-dataset/home. It contains different types of IoT attacks as well as their families. The dataset consists of three major categories. One is binary which has a binary label distribution consisting of 40073 Normal instances and 585710 Anomaly instances. The second category has a category label distribution consisting of 40073 Normal instances, 59391 instances of DoS, 415677 instances of Mirai, 35377 instances of MITM, and 75265 instances of Scan attack. The third category has a subcategory label distribution with 1211811 Brute Force instances, 55818 instances of HTTP Flooding, 183554 instances of UDP Flooding, and some other attack categories.

## Experimental Setup
We executed the proposed system on Google Colaboratory which facilitates the execution of arbitrary Python code with GPU back-end. The compute resources used in this study consist of a Nvidia K80 GPU with a memory of 12 GB. A total disk space of 358 GB was utilized to handle the data with 12 GB of RAM. The GPU memory clock was utilized at 0.82 GHz with a performance of 4.1 TFLOPS.
The IP addresses are given in string format in the dataset. To use them as our feature data, we converted them into int or float data types. First, we have converted the Source and Destination IPs into integer format using the IP address library. After that feature values are assigned to label values as both of them are present in different containers. After that, we converted different categories of Cat columns into numbers for which we used dummy libraries to divide each category into different columns. Then we merged those converted categories with the input table and dropped the column of the category that contains string values.

## Execution:
1.	To execute the code, first download the data cleaning file which performs all the necessary operations preprocessing operations on the dataset. This includes label encoding and checking the distribution of different types of attacks in the dataset. The attacks are categorized into three major groups. This code generates a .csv file that contains the cleaned dataset.

3.	The second step is to perform the data balancing method. The data generated from the previous file is balanced against all the classes. SMOTE oversampling is performed for data balancing and this code generates a resultant CSV file with balanced data.

5.	This balanced dataset generated from the previous file further undergoes the feature selection phase.

7.	After the dataset is prepared, the first tier applies the machine learning-based classifiers including the decision tree, naïve Bayes, and SVM to classify between normal and anomaly data.
8.	The second tier applies the hybrid deep learning model for anomaly type detection and classification.
